## Description:
  Masked Karen is a website for Karens of all walks of life to come together and share their distaste for people not adhering to social distancing and mask wearing guidelines. On this website you can report establishments that aren't adhering to COVID-19 rules as well as add images of said places, or on the other hand praise establishments that are doing a good job of implementing rules and keeping us all safe. Also feel free to send us pictures of you and your family/friends wearing your masks and you could be featured in our "Your Pictures" page!
